Lets discuss Api
now you will see tons of data about this on the internet and it will tell you a lot of different things about it but the most basic thing that you have to know
about an api is 'It is a program which is working with another porgam over the internet to process the data and give you the output' this is the fundamental working
principle of an API

About this Project
this project shows a simple api which takes input from another programs output(using the http get method) and shows you the data in the page

i will try to describe each code below the description field 

Thanks

the general wokring structure of an api is either we send some data to it. it takes the data process it and give us the input . or we get data from the api
BUT NOW LETS DISCUSS A DIFFERENT CASE
so this is an api endpoint https://api.ipify.org/?format=json
now if you click the link you will get you ip address as response but the format will be set to JSON value
now this time 
https://api.ipify.org/?format=txt (click on this link)
now what happens this time is that we get the same response but here to value is turned to txt instead of an json object

the entire point of this api is to show that sometimes some api not only just give you response but also gave it in the way that you from it
in the first scenario we have asked the return value as JSON and the second time as txt
now as a developer sometimes some api gives us this benifit to get the response data according to our own desired format so that we can implement it in the system

SO WE ARE GOING MAKE A PROGRAM WHICH WILL SHOW PERTICULAR DATA STORED IN OUR SYSTEM WHEN USER REQUESTS IT 
WE ARE GOING TO USE NODE JS AND EXPRESS JS FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT

EXPLANATION
so in this problem we have a database where recipies are stored with their steps and time differences our job is to make sure that
whenever a user makes this kind of request (localhost:8000/receipe/1) it should print the receipe with that number 

to run this program
command  = node recepies.js
go to localhost:8000/receipe/1 and change the values

Thanks
